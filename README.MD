# Ambiplayer


The goal of ambiplayer is to play sounds, triggered via rest api or osc.
The need for this piece of software arose during tour preparations of the band [KOENIX](https://koenix-band.ch) as we wanted to play ambient sounds in between songs.
At first we tried [Soundr](https://git.project-name-here.de/Project-Name-Here/soundr) (shoutout and thanks!) but quickly realized, we need more than it provides in its current state.
So Ambiplayer got born.

# What does it do?

- Load Sounds into buffer
- Instant play on rest/osc trigger
- Fade -in/ -out, pause, play, stop
- Play multiple instances of the same sound
- Control all playing sounds

in short, it's a glorified soundboard with a web gui and api.

# What's next?

As this is, and likely always will be, a work in progress, don't expect rapid development or regular improvements.
Its purpose is to work reliable and prove itself in our touring setup.
